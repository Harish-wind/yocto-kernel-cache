Subject: [PATCH 29/83] printk: Add NMI check to console_flush_on_panic() and
 console_unblank()

The printk path is NMI safe because it only adds content to the
buffer and then triggers the delayed output via irq_work. If the
console is flushed or unblanked on panic (from NMI context) then it
can deadlock in down_trylock_console_sem() because the semaphore is
not NMI safe.

Avoid taking the console_lock when flushing in panic and the current
context is NMI. Since the consoles are encouraged to ignore their
locks and also will stop printing if not the panic CPU, this change
does not really make things any more dangerous. But it does avoid
a possible deadlock in NMI context.

Skip unblanking in panic if the current context is NMI.
